/*
All objects created by object literals have the same prototype object --- Object.prototype

that is to say, javaScript objects have a set of "own properties," and they also inherit a set of properties from their prototype object.

Almost all objects have a prototype, but only a small number of objects have a protytpe property. These objects with prototype properties define the prototypes for all other objects.
